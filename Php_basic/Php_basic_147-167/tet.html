        <p>What is Thunderbird used for?
            Thunderbird is a free, open-source
            , cross-platform application for 
            managing email, news feeds, chat,
             and news groups. It is a local 
             email application, meaning it 
             installs and runs as a client
              on your device, being rather 
              than browser or web-based. 
              It is powerful yet easy-to-use through 
               its many features.</p>
